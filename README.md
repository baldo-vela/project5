# Greatest Hits 2.0, A Single Page Application built in React-Redux and the Redux Tool-Kit

This project was created with as a demonstration of a full-stack web-application, with a Javascript Single Page Application (SPA) dynamically querying and rendering the content provided backend Application Programming Interface (API) by Spotify directly.

The goal being a comprehensive display of proficiency with the React library to build a user-facing application. In addition to tying together previous knowledge of constructing a functional Rails powered backend.

Greatest Hits 2.0 code base is seperated into two repositories, this one which is the client facing User Interface (UI). The Ruby on Rails server repository is currently depreciated as this application currently derives all of it's functionality from the Spotify API directly. It's purpose is to provide a social expansion of existing Spotify playlists. By using React-Router, we hope to enable better SEO exposure.
